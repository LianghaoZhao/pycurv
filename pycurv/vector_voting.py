"""
Contains a function implementing the normal vector voting algorithm (Page et
al., 2002) with adaptation.

The main differences to the original method are usage of a graph (TriangleGraph
object) representing the underlying surface and approximating geodesic distances
by shortest distances along the graph edges. Uses several methods of the
TriangleGraph class in the surface_graphs module, which implement triangle-wise
operations of the algorithm.
